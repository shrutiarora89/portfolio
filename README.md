# Portfolio MVC

This is a simple blogging system front end. The code is organized with MVC principles in mind.

It starts small, but will be gaining new features regularly.

-----------------
User Stories: MVP   Branch - portfolio-02

Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST. This means your links to NOT navigate to a newpage.

Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
You can use data-attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab

Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked,
-you hide all the sections,
-then reveal the associated section only.

As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.
